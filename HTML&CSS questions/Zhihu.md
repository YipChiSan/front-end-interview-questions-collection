> What is Box model? (什么是盒模型)

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. There is an image on [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) illustrates the box model.

> Give some examples of inline elements, block elements and void elements. What is the difference between inline and block element? (行内元素有哪些？块级元素有哪些？ 空(void)元素有那些？行内元素和块级元素有什么区别？)

* Block Elements: 
  1. A block-level element always starts on a new line.
  2. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
  3. A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.
  
  Examples: `div`, `li`, `ol`, `p`
  
* Inline Elements:
  1. An inline element does not start on a new line.
  2. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

  Examples: `i`, `a`, `img`, `input`, `label`

* Void Elements:
  A void element is an element whose content model never allows it to have contents under any circumstances. 
  
  Examples: `br`, `img`
